<p>
No one would have believed, in the last years of the
nineteenth century, that human affairs were being watched from the timeless worlds
of space.</p>

<p>
No one could have dreamed we were being scrutinized, as someone with a microscope
studies creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of water. Few men even considered
the possibility of life on other planets and yet, across the gulf of space, minds
immeasurably superior to ours regarded this Earth with envious eyes, and slowly and
surely, they drew their plans against us.
</p>

<p>At midnight on the twelfth of August, a huge mass of luminous gas erupted from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars">Mars</a>
and sped towards <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth">Earth</a>. Across two hundred million miles of void, invisibly hurtling
towards us, came the first of the missiles that were to bring so much calamity to Earth.
As I watched, there was another jet of gas. It was another missile, starting on its way.</p>

seemed so safe and tranquil. </p>
